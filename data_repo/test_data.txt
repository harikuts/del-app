if you give american workers a chance  there’s nothing they can’t do  and if you give america’s companies and communities a chance  there’s nothing they can’t build  that’s why i’ve told every foreign leader  it’s never a good idea to bet against america  we’ve reached a historic deal on infrastructure  folks  the bipartisan infrastructure deal is the largest infrastructure bill in a century  it will grow the economy  create good paying jobs  and set america on a path to win the future i’ve always believed we’re at our best when we’re one america  coming together to get big things done 
 
the cynics said a bipartisan bill wasn’t possible  they doubted our ability to strike a bipartisan deal on infrastructure 
 
we proved them wrong the largest investment in 
 
  public transit in history
  passenger rail since the creation of amtrak
  repairing our nation’s bridges since the construction of the interstate highway system
  clean energy transmission in history
 
that’s the bipartisan infrastructure deal  it’s infrastructure week  “buy american” became a hollow promise in recent years  but my administration is making it a reality  and i’m putting the weight of the federal government behind that commitment with a made in america office in the white house to oversee our efforts trickle down economics has never worked  but when working families do well — everybody does well 

that’s what the economy we’re building is all about tune in as i deliver remarks on the importance of american manufacturing  i was honored to meet with  at the white house this morning  the united states stands with the people of belarus in their quest for democracy and universal human rights  i’m on my way to tour a mack trucks manufacturing facility and highlight the need to ensure the future is made in america — by all of america  see you soon  pennsylvania when we passed the american rescue plan  i promised help was here  and right now  billions of dollars in federal assistance is available to renters and landlords who’ve struggled during the pandemic  to find assistance near you  head to  let me be clear  anti semitism has no place in the state department  in my administration  or anywhere in the world  it’s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor and stand up to bigotry wherever we find it  today’s announcement makes clear that the most important protection we have against the delta variant is the vaccine  although most u s  adults are vaccinated  too many are not and that has to change 
 
get protected   with the bipartisan infrastructure framework  we won’t just fix our crumbling infrastructure of today  we’re going to build for tomorrow  and we’re going to create good paying  union jobs in the process there are no democratic roads or republican bridges — infrastructure impacts us all and i believe we’ve got to come together to find solutions  that’s why i’m working across the aisle to pass the bipartisan infrastructure framework the united states currently ranks 13th in the world in infrastructure  it’s unacceptable — and makes clear the urgent need for the bipartisan infrastructure framework 
 
we can’t wait  send it to my desk when i was running for president  i put together bold  aggressive plans to deliver child care and paid leave — universal pre k and free community college  

i’ll fight to see my build back better agenda enacted  and signed into law throughout his remarkable life  bob moses devoted his heart and soul to leading  teaching  and organizing generations of americans to make real the promise of our nation  let us follow his towering legacy and ensure everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve i was enormously proud to co sponsor the ada as a member of the united states senate  and i was proud to be there today as president alongside so many fearless champions who represent the ongoing legacy of this law from its foundations to its future  the americans with disabilities act is so much more than just a law  americans across the country can see and feel the devastation of climate change  my build back better agenda tackles this existential threat through a new energy efficiency and clean electricity standard  clean energy tax credits  and a new civilian climate corps today  i met with prime minister mustafa al kadhimi of iraq in the oval office  we reaffirmed our commitment to expand cooperation through new initiatives focused on education  health  and climate as well as support for iraq’s democracy and strengthened rule of law  when we passed the ada  we made a commitment — to build this nation for all of us  and we moved america closer to fulfilling that promise of liberty  justice  dignity  and equality for all 
 
and perhaps most importantly — we did it together for more than 60 million americans living with a disability  the ada is so much more than a law  it’s a source of opportunity  participation  independent living  and respect 
 
and for our nation  the ada is more than a law as well  it’s a testament to our character as a people tune in as the vice president and i deliver remarks to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the americans with disabilities act   this afternoon  i’ll be hosting prime minister mustafa al kadhimi for a meeting in the oval office  i look forward to strengthening the strategic partnership between the united states and iraq and working to advance bilateral cooperation today marks the 31st anniversary of the americans with disabilities act — a landmark bill i proudly cosponsored in the senate  while we celebrate the incredible progress we’ve made toward meeting the full aspirations of the ada  we must recommit to the work that remains folks  i couldn’t be more proud of this cabinet  we’re delivering on our promises – and showing that there is nothing america is unable to do when we do it together  getting vaccinated is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and the people around you from the delta variant of covid 19  find a free vaccine near you at  do we want to give the wealthiest people in america another tax cut  or do we want to ask them to pay their fair share  so that we can build an economy that deals everyone in  i think we all know which is best for america’s future the bipartisan infrastructure framework is a great deal for the american people – for blue collar people  the folks being left behind now my dad used to say  “all you want  as a middle class person  is just to have a little bit of breathing room ”  
 
we can deliver for the american people on an infrastructure deal that creates good paying  union jobs  jobs that give families breathing room  let’s get it done  six months into my administration  here’s where we stand  record growth  record job creation  workers getting hard earned breaks  my team will do whatever it takes to get the word out about our plans to build back better – this week they take over the white house twitter account to answer your questions  folks the delta variant is no joke  please protect yourself and your loved ones – get vaccinated under my build back better agenda  middle class families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high quality child care for children up to age five  and the most hard pressed working families won’t have to pay a dime i know we can get the job done on the bipartisan infrastructure framework  it’s going to help us create more good paying  union jobs  ease the burden on working families  and strengthen our economy in the long run the olympians representing our country in tokyo are the embodiment of the spirit and drive that makes america a beacon for the globe  i’m so proud of you  

let’s go  nearly one in four americans can’t afford their prescription drugs  it’s not right 
 
my build back better agenda makes sure medicare can negotiate the cost of prescription drugs – bringing prices down for everyone americans pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in other leading countries  we have to change that  my build back better agenda will lower prescription drug costs for americans by letting medicare negotiate drug prices  

that s a big deal we re building an economy that rewards the working people of this nation and not just those at the top  

my build back better agenda means more jobs  tax cuts  and lower costs – paid for by making the tax code more fair and making sure the wealthiest pay their fair share tune in as i deliver remarks and sign h r 1652  the voca fix to sustain the crime victims fund act of 2021 into law  55 major corporations paid zero in income tax in recent years  

my build back better agenda is going to change that paradigm – and give working families a fighting chance read my full statement  i condemn the mass detentions and sham trials that are the cuban regime s efforts to threaten the cuban people into silence  my administration stands with the cuban people  and is imposing new sanctions targeting those in the cuban regime responsible for this crackdown when i was running for president  i spent a lot of time in town hall venues like the one in ohio last night  promising to build back better for the american people  there s more to do  but with record job growth and over 160 million americans vaccinated – we re back on track  it’s past time the wealthy pay their fair share 

my build back better agenda gets it done with my build back better agenda  we’re going to provide two years of high quality pre school and two years of free community college  because 12 years of education is no longer enough to compete in the 21st century it is unacceptable that we’re one of the few major economies in the world that doesn’t cover paid family and medical leave  forcing workers to make impossible choices between caregiving and a paycheck 

my build back better agenda will finally change that with my build back better agenda  we’ll inspire and lead the world with the opportunities we provide  the cures we discover  the technologies we pioneer  and the industries we create 
 
there’s nothing america can’t accomplish if we do it together congratulations to the nba champions milwaukee  on claiming your first nba title in 50 years  your city and your president are proud we’re seeing devastating impacts of the climate crisis every day – and we need to act  my build back better agenda will help us meet the moment by providing clean energy tax credits  creating a new civilian climate corps  and investing in new technologies to fight climate change the bipartisan infrastructure framework and build back better agenda will give our workforce a boost – leading to increased wages and lower prices in years ahead  thanks  for stopping by the white house today  your team is the embodiment of a quintessential lesson about sports and about america itself  that no matter how much we get knocked down – we get up  you can’t flip the global economy back on like a light switch  as demand returns  there are going to be temporary global supply chain challenges  that’s a real challenge – and my administration is doing everything we can to address it  by fully vaccinating 160 million americans and 80  of our seniors – we’ve fundamentally changed the course of the pandemic  but we cannot let up – especially because of the delta variant  if you haven’t gotten vaccinated yet  now is the time today i’m meeting with my cabinet – a cabinet that looks like america  i’m incredibly optimistic about what we’ll be able to build together in the years to come tune in as i welcome the tampa bay buccaneers to the white house to honor the team for their super bowl lv championship 
 six months in  here’s where we stand  

record job creation  over 160 million americans fully vaccinated  one of the largest middle class tax cuts ever – the child tax credit – in bank accounts  we can t stop now  we need the infrastructure deal and my build back better agenda jill and i send our warmest greetings to those celebrating eid al adha  the eid traditions and hajj rituals are a reminder of the importance of providing for those less fortunate and the shared roots of the world’s abrahamic faiths  have a safe and wonderful holiday i met today with his majesty king abdullah ii of jordan to express my gratitude for his steadfast friendship and consult with him on a range of challenges and opportunities in the middle east  the u s  jordan strategic partnership is as important as ever  thanks to the american rescue plan  our economy is growing faster than it has in nearly 40 years  we are six months into my administration  and the u s  economy is experiencing the highest economic growth in nearly 40 years when i took office  my administration knew we needed a war time effort to get america vaccinated – and to pass a powerful american rescue plan  we did both 

now  forecasters have doubled their projections of growth this year to about 7  or higher  the highest in nearly 40 years folks  we can t go back to the same old trickle down theories that gave us nearly  2 trillion in deficit financed corporate tax giveaways and did nothing to make our economy more productive or resilient 

we need to grow this economy from the bottom up and the middle out since i took office six months ago  we’ve gone from 60 000 new jobs per month – to 60 000 every three days 

that’s the fastest job growth at this point in any administration in history tune in as i deliver remarks on our economic recovery and the need for the bipartisan infrastructure framework and the build back better agenda   i look forward to welcoming  ibn al hussein  amp  queen rania al abdullah of the hashemite kingdom of jordan  amp  his royal highness crown prince al hussein bin abdullah ii  to the white house  we re committed to the enduring and strategic partnership between our nations happy national ice cream day  folks  our children are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft  my build back better agenda makes once in a generation investments in their care and education  with the delta variant on the rise across the country  it’s more important than ever to get vaccinated  head to  to find a clinic near you with the build back better agenda  we’re going to lower health care costs by lowering premiums and reducing prescription costs — and we’ll expand coverage  because every american deserves access to quality  affordable health care this week  payments started going out to nearly every working family in the country thanks to the expanded child tax credit  it’s going to make a world of difference for countless americans and lift millions of kids out of poverty 
 
help is here with the american rescue plan whether it’s about my plans to build back better or my love of ice cream  i get asked a lot of questions on the internet every day  so  for this week’s conversation  i sat down to answer a few  days before he died one year ago today  jill and i spoke with john lewis for the last time  he asked us to remain focused on the unfinished work – his life’s work – of healing and uniting this nation  with john’s spirit guiding us  we must be unafraid and never give up   well  you know they have to cover me wherever i travel  so the least i could do is make sure they get some ice cream     you’re absolutely right  the bipartisan infrastructure deal is the largest investment in clean drinking water in history  replacing all the lead pipes and service lines in america read my full statement  
 
 yesterday’s federal court ruling is deeply disappointing  while the court’s order does not now affect current daca recipients  this decision nonetheless relegates hundreds of thousands of young immigrants to an uncertain future  it is my fervent hope that congress will act the build back better agenda combined with the bipartisan infrastructure framework is a once in a generation investment in our nation’s future  
 
together  they’ll rebuild our infrastructure  invest in families  and combat the climate crisis the build back better agenda starts with education  we’re going to provide four additional years of school to everyone in america — two years of universal pre school and two years of free community college — and strengthen k 12 education as the first woman chancellor  angela merkel’s life is one of groundbreaking service to germany and the world  thank you  angela  for your career of strong and principled leadership  for always speaking out for what is right  and for never failing to defend human dignity  folks  it’s never been more convenient or more important to get vaccinated  watch dr  fauci and  answer fan tweets – and then head to  to find a vaccine near you  under chancellor merkel  the friendship and cooperation between germany and the united states has grown stronger and stronger  it was an honor to host her at the white house  it was an honor to welcome my dear friend chancellor merkel to the white house  in today’s meetings we agreed to the washington declaration — a document that affirms our shared commitment to democratic principles and pledges to apply them to meet the biggest challenges we face  tune in as i host a press conference with german chancellor angela merkel   there’s just one month left to sign up for health insurance on  — with costs at an all time low thanks to the american rescue plan  sign up by august 15 and join the over two million americans who’ve gotten covered during this special enrollment period today  help is here  and my build back better agenda keeps this tax cut for working families in place for years to come 

and so i say to my colleagues in congress  the expanded child tax credit for working families is something we should extend — not end to give you a sense of how transformative the expanded child tax credit is  it’s going to spur the largest ever one year decrease in child poverty in american history the expanded child tax credit is one of the largest ever single year tax cuts for families with children  and it’s a reflection of my belief that the people who need a tax cut aren’t those at the top  it’s the folks in the middle  and the folks who are struggling tune in as the vice president and i deliver remarks on the start of monthly child tax credit relief payments  i look forward to welcoming german chancellor angela merkel to the white house this afternoon for a bilateral meeting  the partnership between our two nations is ironclad — and we’re committed to working together to tackle our shared challenges in the years ahead my build back better agenda will provide access to quality  affordable child care  middle class families will pay no more than 7  of their income for high quality care for children up to age 5 — and the most hard pressed working families won’t pay a dime today is a historic day for our country  because beginning this morning  nearly all working families started receiving their first tax cut payment from the child tax credit of up to  300 per child 

help is here with the american rescue plan thanks for stopping by  olivia  and for using your voice to urge young people to get vaccinated  if we all do our part and get the covid 19 vaccine  we can defeat this virus once and for all  let’s do this  today  i stopped by capitol hill to continue making the case for the bipartisan infrastructure framework and my build back better agenda  
 
together  they represent historic investments in infrastructure  clean energy  and families that will create jobs and raise wages this afternoon  i’ll be meeting with a bipartisan group of governors and mayors to discuss the bipartisan infrastructure framework  they know firsthand the need to rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure — and together  we’ll get it done olivia rodrigo is stopping by the white house today with a clear message to young people  get vaccinated  it’s the best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from the dangerous new covid 19 variants  head to  to find a clinic near you the denial of full  free  and fair elections is the most un american thing imaginable  this year  17 states have enacted 28 new laws to make it harder to vote  not to mention the nearly 400 bills that republican members of state legislatures are trying to pass 

this 21st century jim crow assault is real  it is unrelenting — and we will challenge it vigorously to protect our democracy and the sanctity of the vote  we must pass the for the people act and the john lewis voting rights advancement act 

it is a national imperative for those who challenge the results and question the integrity of the 2020 election — no other election has ever been held to such scrutiny and high standard 

the “big lie” is just that — the big lie tune in as i deliver remarks on the sacred  constitutional right to vote  today  the u s  conference of mayors — republican and democratic mayors from across the country — announced support for our bipartisan infrastructure deal  mayors and governors know we need to get this done this afternoon  i met with the attorney general  law enforcement officials  and local leaders to discuss our comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crimes  we’re committed to working together with state and local officials to keep americans safe  the surge in gun violence and violent crime over the last year and a half is unacceptable — and we’re carrying out our comprehensive strategy to combat it  we need to deal with the shortage of affordable housing in america  with my build back better agenda  we’re going to make a historic investment in affordable housing — increasing and improving the housing supply by building or rehabilitating more than 2 million homes gun violence has plagued our nation for too long — and my administration is taking action to end it  in that effort  i’m meeting with the attorney general  law enforcement officials  and local leaders this afternoon to discuss our comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crimes we stand with the cuban people as they bravely assert their fundamental and universal rights  and as they all call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering  more than 65 million americans have only one reliable high speed internet provider — forcing them to pay up to five times more on average than families in places with more choices 

that’s why i called on the fcc to increase competition and lower prices for americans get vaccinated  folks  it’s free  it’s effective  and it’s never been easier or more important a few companies control the market for many vital medicines  causing americans to pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in other countries 

i ordered the fda to work with states and tribes to safely import prescription drugs from canada to lower prices with my build back better agenda  we’re not just going back to the way things were before the pandemic  we’re building a new economy that works for every american  the american families plan is a transformational investment in families — and there’s a lot in it  so  for this week’s conversation  i asked susan rice and cecilia rouse to break down this important piece of my build back better agenda  congratulations  zaila  we’re all so proud of you  i have a feeling this isn’t the last time you’ll be making history  let me be clear  capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism  it’s exploitation to keep our country moving  we have to bring fair competition back to this economy  that’s why today  i’m signing an executive order promoting competition 

it’ll lower prices  increase wages  and take another critical step toward an economy that works for everyone tune in as i deliver remarks and sign an executive order on promoting competition in the american economy  congratulations to the tampa bay lightning on your second straight stanley cup  you made your city and your country proud as i’ve said again and again  the people who really need a tax break in this country are working families  that’s why my build back better agenda will extend the expanded child tax credit we passed under my american rescue plan one year ago  i announced my build back better agenda  we’ve made incredible progress with our rescue plan  covid response  and infrastructure negotiations — but we’re not done yet 

we must pass the remainder of my agenda to rebuild an economy that works for every american when i announced our drawdown in april  i said we would be out of afghanistan by september  our military mission in afghanistan will in fact conclude on august 31st  and the drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way  prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart  with voting rights under attack across the country  it’s more important than ever that we act  today  the vice president and i met with civil rights leaders to discuss how we protect the sacred right to vote and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box  we will never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for our country in afghanistan – nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service 
 
we are ending america’s longest war  but we will always honor those who served in it we are repositioning our resources to meet terror threats where they are now  across south asia  the middle east  and africa 
 
but make no mistake  we have the capabilities to protect the homeland from any resurgent terrorist challenge emanating from afghanistan tune in as i give an update on our ongoing drawdown efforts in afghanistan and our continued support for the andsf and the afghan people  this afternoon  the vice president and i will be meeting with black leaders of legacy civil rights organizations  we have urgent work before us — and we are committed to doing everything we can to protect the sacred right to vote and pass the george floyd justice in policing act think about this  if you ask the top 1  to pay the same tax rate they paid in 2001  when george w  bush was president  that would generate  13 billion a year  that’s enough to provide two years of community college free to every student in america 
 
we need a fairer tax system it’s time for us to think bigger  act bolder  and build back better we are one of the few major economies in the world that does not cover paid family and medical leave  my build back better agenda will change that by providing up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave we can’t wait any longer to deal with the climate crisis  my build back better agenda will provide tax cuts for businesses and consumers who invest in clean energy technologies — and set a clean electricity standard that moves us to a fully clean and reliable grid we are shocked and saddened to hear of the horrific assassination of president jovenel moïse and the attack on first lady martine moïse of haiti  we condemn this heinous act — and stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure haiti the fact is 12 years of education is no longer enough to compete in the 21st century 
 
that’s why my build back better agenda will guarantee four additional years of public education for every person in america – two years of pre school and two years of free community college to win the 21st century  to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out  to deal everyone in – we need to invest in our people tune in as i highlight how my build back better agenda will deliver for working families across the country  covid 19 deaths are down by 90  since we took office 
millions of fully vaccinated americans are getting back to their lives 
businesses are reopening and hiring across the country 
projected economic growth is the highest it’s been in four decades 
 
america is on the move i’m on my way to illinois to highlight how my build back better agenda will help working families  see you soon  crystal lake jill and i are keeping everyone in hurricane elsa’s path in our prayers  please take steps to prepare  heed the advice of local officials  and stay safe  if you haven’t yet  please get vaccinated  it’s the best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from the dangerous new covid 19 variants 

let’s finish this virus once and for all  six months ago today  insurrectionists carried out a violent and deadly assault on our capitol  it was a test of whether our democracy could survive  half a year later we can declare unequivocally that democracy did prevail 

now  it falls on all of us to protect and preserve it last week  i welcomed the dodgers to the white house to congratulate them for their world series victory  thanks for stopping by    tune in as i give an update on our covid 19 response and vaccination program  when we stand together  when we unite in common cause  when we see ourselves not as republicans or democrats  but as americans  then there’s simply no limit to what we can achieve  we’re closer than ever to declaring our independence from covid 19  but the fight is not over yet  powerful strains like the delta variant have emerged 

the best defense against these deadly variants is simple  get vaccinated we never again want to be where we were a year ago  while the virus hasn’t been vanquished  we know this  it no longer controls our lives or paralyzes our nation  and we can make sure it never does again  find a vaccine near you at   it’s never been a good bet to bet against america  over the past year  we have lived through some of our darkest days  now  i truly believe we are about to see our brightest future  today  we see the results of the unity of purpose we are forging in our nation 
 
for together  we are beating this virus 
 
together  we are breathing life into our economy 
 
and together  we will rescue our people from division and despair if you haven’t gotten vaccinated  please do it now  it’s the most patriotic thing you can do this year  the fourth of july is a day of special celebration  for we are emerging from the darkest of years  a year of pandemic and isolation  a year of pain  fear  and heartbreaking loss

always great to host world series champs at the white house  no malarkey here  our economic growth means that instead of workers competing with each other for jobs  employers are competing with each other to attract workers

our democracy depends on it today  the first lady and i are in surfside  florida to meet and thank first responders and to comfort the families enduring this tragedy 
 
our hearts go out to these families  those working around the clock to respond to this tragedy have our deepest gratitude folks  i’m a car guy – and i firmly believe the future is electric  gina mccarthy and secretary granholm hit the road to talk about the bipartisan infrastructure framework’s historic investments in electric vehicles and how we’re going to ensure the future is made in america  one in five miles of highway in our country is in poor condition  with the bipartisan infrastructure framework we’re going to put people to work in great paying jobs making it right  climate change is fueling wildfires of greater intensity  that move with more speed  and last well beyond the traditional months 
 
today  we’re taking critical steps to help protect american communities right away  tune in as i discuss wildfire prevention  preparedness  and response efforts  no one should have to fear lead in their kids’ water  the bipartisan infrastructure framework gets it done  the bipartisan infrastructure framework is a generational investment to modernize our infrastructure  create millions of good paying jobs  and position america to win the 21st century this bipartisan infrastructure framework is a huge deal for this country  in wisconsin  more than 1 000 bridges are structurally deficient  82 000 children lack access to reliable internet  and there are more than 70 000 lead service lines in milwaukee alone 

i stopped by la crosse to share how the bipartisan infrastructure framework will change that  to lgbtq  folks across the country — no matter where you are on your journey — know you are loved and accepted just as you are  in some american cities  people of color are twice as likely to rely on public transit to get to work  the bipartisan infrastructure framework will invest  48 5 billion in public transit to ensure americans — especially communities of color — have more transit options one in five miles of our highways and roads are in poor condition  40  of our bridges are over 50 years old 

the bipartisan infrastructure framework will put americans to work in good paying jobs and change that the american people can be proud  because this country came together and forged a bipartisan infrastructure deal that delivers for everybody 

we’ve shown the world — and we’ve shown ourselves — that american democracy can come through tune in as i highlight how the bipartisan infrastructure framework will help communities across the country  we have no time to waste when it comes to making our infrastructure more resilient to a changing climate  the bipartisan infrastructure framework invests  52 billion to strengthen our natural infrastructure — like coastlines and levees — and our physical infrastructure the bipartisan infrastructure framework represents a crucial step forward in combating the climate crisis  it’ll make the largest investment in clean energy transmission in american history  modernizing our power grid to accelerate the build out of zero carbon  renewable energy i’m on my way to la crosse to highlight the benefits of the bipartisan infrastructure framework  see you soon  wisconsin besides these unprecedented investments  the bipartisan infrastructure framework represents the largest federal investment in bridges since the interstate highway system was built and the largest federal investment in public rail since amtrak was created let’s be clear about how big a deal the bipartisan infrastructure framework is  it’s the largest federal investment in 

  public transit
  clean energy transmission
  clean drinking water

in american history you’re on pal   i have always believed that there is nothing our nation can’t do when we decide to do it together  last week  we began to write a new chapter in that story with the bipartisan infrastructure framework  congratulations to the people of armenia and prime minister  on successful parliamentary elections  our partnership with armenia is one of shared values and cooperation on democratic reform and conflict resolution—we are committed to strengthening that partnership we’re building a workers economy this afternoon  i’ll be meeting with israeli president reuven rivlin at the white house  i’m looking forward to highlighting the strength of the bilateral relationship between our two nations and working together to achieve security and stability in the region every american deserves access to clean drinking water — and the bipartisan infrastructure framework will make that a reality by eliminating the nation’s lead service lines and pipes 

it’s the largest investment in clean drinking water infrastructure in our history the bipartisan infrastructure framework represents the largest federal investment in public transit in history — including the largest passenger rail investment since the creation of amtrak 

i might be a little biased  but that’s a big deal we can do this  folks  get vaccinated – and let’s defeat this virus once and for all  after four years of relentless attacks on lgbtq  rights  my administration has taken historic actions to accelerate the march toward full lgbtq  equality  you heard her  folks  head to   my heart is with the community of surfside as they grieve their lost loved ones and wait anxiously as search and rescue efforts continue  

yesterday i spoke with gov  desantis to let him know that we are ready to provide assistance as needed by state and local officials read my full statement  the bipartisan infrastructure framework would be good for the economy and good for our people 
 
we need both this and the american families plan — it was always my hope to reach a bipartisan deal on infrastructure while seeking to pass my families plan through reconciliation it was an honor to welcome president ghani and chairman abdullah to the white house this afternoon 

we will continue to provide assistance through our enduring partnership with afghanistan to promote a peaceful and stable future that the afghan people want and deserve  yesterday  i signed a law designating the pulse nightclub a national memorial  just over five years ago  the nightclub    a place of acceptance and joy    became a place of unspeakable pain and loss  we will never fully recover  but we will always remember  we’ve made incredible progress in the fight against covid 19  we can finish this thing  hear from dr  murthy and natalie quillian about how getting vaccinated is the key to bringing an end to this pandemic  so far this year  hundreds of anti lgbtq bills have been introduced in state legislatures – many of them target transgender children  
 
let’s be clear  this is bullying against kids disguised as legislation – and it must stop  enough is enough tune in as we commemorate lgbtq  pride month at the white house   i look forward to hosting president ghani and chairman abdullah at the white house this afternoon  as the u s  military drawdown continues  we affirm our enduring support for the afghan people folks  this means good paying  union jobs that can’t be outsourced  millions of jobs that provide a middle class life with a little breathing room  

and we’re doing it all without raising a cent from earners below  400 000 — no gas tax increase  and no fee on electric vehicles  american workers will be installing electric vehicle charging stations and undertaking critical environmental clean ups  the plan also creates a financing authority that will leverage private capital into infrastructure and clean energy projects  this agreement will put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing 100  of the nation’s lead water pipes so that every american can turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water  this agreement will deliver high speed internet to every american home and put people to work all across the country building transmission lines and upgrading our power grid to be more energy efficient and resilient to extreme weather and the climate crisis  this bipartisan agreement represents the largest investment in public transit in american history and the largest investment in rail since the creation of amtrak  it will put americans to work in good paying jobs — repairing our roads and bridges  folks  this bipartisan infrastructure framework is a big deal for american workers and families  here’s just some of what’s in it  the bipartisan infrastructure framework will provide folks with good paying jobs that can’t be outsourced — the kind of jobs that provide a middle class life with a little breathing room 

and we’re going to do it all without raising a cent from earners below  400 000 together  we’ve forged an agreement that will create millions of american jobs modernizing our nation’s infrastructure  hear more from press secretary jen psaki here  we need physical infrastructure

since we took office  we’ve gone from an economy in crisis to one that is projected to grow faster than it has in nearly 40 years  

that’s progress  let’s keep it going the american jobs plan is a once in a generation opportunity to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure  create millions of good paying jobs  and win the future  watch as secretary buttigieg breaks the plan down  i was honored to host h e  moon jae in  president of the republic of korea  the alliance between our two nations is stronger than ever and the linchpin of peace  security  and prosperity for northeast asia  the indo pacific  and the world  h e  moon jae in  president of the republic of korea  and i just finished our bilateral meeting at the white house  tune in for our joint press conference  the truth is we have no time to waste when it comes to the threat of climate change 

we need to act  we need the american jobs plan before we took office  the economy was creating an average of just 60 000 jobs a month 

now  we’re creating an average of over 500 000 jobs every month 

we’re building back better every day tune in as i award the medal of honor to army colonel ralph puckett  this afternoon  i’m hosting h e  moon jae in  president of the republic of korea  at the white house for a bilateral meeting  i look forward to renewing the ironclad alliance between our two nations while working side by side to tackle our shared challenges i believe that palestinians and israelis equally deserve to live in safety and security and to enjoy equal measures of freedom  prosperity  and democracy  

my administration will continue our quiet and relentless diplomacy toward that end  these hostilities have resulted in the tragic deaths of so many civilians  including children  i send my sincere condolences to all the families  israeli and palestinian  of those who lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery for the wounded prime minister netanyahu informed me that israel has agreed to a mutual  unconditional ceasefire  the egyptians have now informed us that hamas and the other groups in gaza have also agreed tune in as i deliver remarks on the middle east  incidents of hate against asian americans have seen a shocking spike over the last year  it’s wrong — and it’s un american 
 
to all those who are hurting  we see you and we are committed to stopping the hatred and bias tune in as i sign the covid 19 hate crimes act into law  with the hard work and ingenuity of the american people  there’s not a single thing we cannot accomplish  to everyone struggling with mental health  i want you to know you are not alone  on this mental health action day  my administration is committed to eliminating barriers and ensuring everyone has the support they need to heal  recover  and thrive hate has no place in america – and i look forward to making that clear this afternoon by signing the covid 19 hate crimes act into law i was honored to speak at the coast guard academy’s commencement today  to the class of 2021  congratulations  may god protect you all as you set out on your journeys  and may god protect all those who wear the uniform of the united states of america  community college should be free 

the american families plan will finally make that a reality for millions of americans mark my words  the future will be made in america get vaccinated tune in as i address the graduating cadets at the united states coast guard academy’s 140th commencement  when we took office four months ago  the economy was in crisis  we knew there was no time to waste  so we got right to work 

now  we’re creating an average of 500 000 jobs a month and building an economy that works for all — not just those at the top 
 
that’s progress get in folks  we’re going to win the competition for the 21st century  being at ford’s rouge electric vehicle center today brought me home  for more than thirty years  my dad managed car dealerships in delaware  he would’ve loved visiting this complex  where you feel the history and see the future of an iconic american industry  as a former public defender  i’ve seen how timely and affordable access to the legal system can make all the difference  but low income people have long struggled to secure quality access  that’s why today  i took action to expand access to legal representation and the courts here’s the deal  trickle down economics has never worked 

it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out when i think of the climate crisis  i think of jobs 

if we act to save the planet we can create millions of jobs  generate significant economic growth  and raise the standard of living of people around the world the american jobs plan is a blue collar blueprint to rebuild america  it’s a plan that will leave no one behind  that’s why nearly 90  of the jobs created in the plan do not require a bachelor’s degree the previous administration had infrastructure week every week for four years  but did nothing to get the job done 

folks  the rest of the world is moving fast ahead  and we’ve got to step up join me as i give remarks on the american jobs plan  i’m on my way to dearborn to tour the ford rouge electric vehicle center  see you soon  michigan in march  i signed the american rescue plan into law — giving 90  of families with children a tax cut 

we’re making our tax system work for the middle class  if you’re a firefighter or a teacher  you’re paying a higher tax rate than most of corporate america  it’s unacceptable  i’m sick and tired of corporations not paying their fair share 

we’re going to change that with 90  of americans living within five miles of a vaccination center  it’s never been easier to get your covid 19 shot  head to  today to find a location near you 

get vaccinated  folks for working families with children  this tax cut sends a clear message  help is here  on this international day against homophobia  transphobia  and biphobia  the message from the united states is clear  everyone deserves dignity and equality  no matter who they are or whom they love  we’re committed to advancing lgbtq  rights here at home and around the world america will never be fully safe while this pandemic is raging globally  that’s why today  i’m announcing that over the next six weeks we will send 80 million vaccine doses overseas 
 
it is the right thing to do  it is the smart thing to do  it is the strong thing to do when tomorrow’s vaccination numbers come out  they will show that 60  of american adults have received at least one shot 
 
every day  the light at the end of the tunnel grows brighter tune in as i give an update on covid 19 vaccinations  over one million americans have signed up for health insurance during our special open enrollment period  that’s a big deal 
 
join them and head to  to sign up before august 15 i refuse to stand by and let america fall behind while other nations race ahead 

it’s time we invest in our future again  it’s time for the american jobs plan we’ve made incredible progress in the fight against covid 19  but we’re not done yet  get vaccinated and then ensure your family  friends  and neighbors do as well 
 
let’s finish strong  folks we need reliable  resilient infrastructure if we’re going to compete in the 21st century  we need the american jobs plan last week i had the chance to meet with dreamers in the oval office  these young people are part of the fabric of our nation and vital to our future 

congress needs to pass the u s  citizenship act and create a path to citizenship for dreamers  farm workers  and tps holders now  if you re fully vaccinated  you can now go mask less in most settings 

but remember  it’s going to take time for everyone who wants to get vaccinated to get their shots  and some vaccinated people prefer masks  so please  if you see someone with a mask  treat them with kindness  every day  we ask a great deal of those who serve in our nation’s law enforcement agencies  as we recognize peace officers memorial day and police week  my administration is committed to doing everything we can to support the men and women who serve  i know folks have a lot of questions about covid 19  the vaccines  and the latest mask guidance  so  we had the nation’s top experts break things down for this week’s conversation  check it out  it’s long past time congress pass the u s  citizenship act  

dreamers  farm workers  and tps holders deserve a path to citizenship  full stop since the start of our administration  we’ve created over 1 5 million jobs  we’ve come a long way  but the truth is we still have further to go  congress needs to pass the american jobs plan which will create millions of good paying jobs rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure this is our moment to build an economy that works for everyone — not just the super wealthy and giant corporations  
 
let’s get it done after a long year of sacrifice  americans who are fully vaccinated can stop wearing masks in most settings  we have more to do — but this is great news  folks  if you’re fully vaccinated — you no longer need to wear a mask 

if you’re not vaccinated yet — go to  to find a shot  and mask up until you’re fully vaccinated  as the holy month of ramadan comes to an end  jill and i send our warmest greetings to all those celebrating eid  may you be well throughout the year  eid mubarak  the rule is now simple  get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do   

the choice is yours just a few hours ago  the centers for disease control and prevention  the cdc  announced that they are no longer recommending that fully vaccinated people need to wear masks – whether inside or outside join me as i address the new cdc mask guidance  the extraordinary measures my administration has taken  we estimate  sent enough fuel to gas stations to fill the tanks of over five million vehicles in the last few days my administration has mobilized a whole of government response to get more fuel quickly and safely to where it is needed and to limit the pain being felt by american consumers join me as i give an update on the colonial pipeline incident  kids 12 and up can now get the pfizer covid 19 vaccine  parents  protect your kids  your family  and your community — get your kids 12 and up vaccinated  parents  kids 12 and up can now get the pfizer covid 19 vaccine  go to  and find a vaccine near you  good news  adolescents 12 and up can now get the pfizer covid 19 vaccine  hear more from dr  walensky about how the covid 19 vaccine protects kids and their families  tomorrow we will cross 250 million vaccine shots administered since we took office  

it’s a truly remarkable achievement for the nation today  an independent advisory committee to the cdc voted to recommend the pfizer biontech vaccine for adolescents 12 and older 

it’s one more giant step in our fight against the pandemic tune in as i give an update on our covid 19 response and the vaccination program  this morning  vice president harris and i met with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders  as i’ve said before  we can’t let the divisions of the present stop us from doing right by the future  we’re committed to working together to build back better for the american people  today more than 150 million americans have gotten at least one shot 
 
that’s progress — but we have more to do  remember  go get vaccinated  today  i met with a bipartisan group of governors to thank them for their partnership in the fight against covid 19 and to discuss our next steps  this is not about red states and blue states  it’s about what america can achieve when we come together and all do our part  every single american deserves access to clean drinking water  period 

we’re going to make that a reality with the american jobs plan we’re working hard to ensure transportation is less of a barrier when it comes to getting a covid 19 vaccine  and i’m excited to share that starting may 24th  uber and lyft will offer everyone in america free rides to vaccination sites today  more than 150 million americans have gotten at least one shot  cases  hospitalizations  and deaths are all down 
 
millions of americans are starting to live life more normally after more than a year of sacrifice 
 
that’s progress tune in as i give an update on our economic recovery and covid 19  the american rescue plan has allocated  39 billion to address the child care crisis caused by covid 19 so that parents who need to can return to work  

the american families plan would ensure access to high quality  affordable child care beyond the pandemic  

let s pass it the american rescue plan is getting us back on track — but we need to go further  we need the american jobs plan  covid 19 has shown us just how necessary it is to center the needs of women and girls in our health care system  this national women s health week  we’re doubling down on our commitment to equal access to health care  no one should ever be denied access to health care because of their sexual orientation or gender identity  that’s why today  we announced new protections from health care discrimination 
 
to every lgbtq  american out there  i want you to know  the president has your back we need the american jobs plan  it’s an eight year investment strategy to make sure the working people of this country get to share in the benefits of a rising economy since the time i took office  we’ve created more than 1 5 million jobs in the country 

it’s the most jobs created in the first hundred days of any president on record tune in as i give an update on our economic recovery and the next steps we’re going to take  checks to people who are hurting 
support for small businesses  child care  and school reopening 
help for families to put food on the table 

the american rescue plan is working — but we need to go further  we need the american jobs plan don’t forget to call your moms today  folks  happy mother’s day to the love of my life and the life of my love  jill  this has been an extraordinarily tough year for moms across this country  to all the moms who have carried us through this pandemic — as frontline workers  caregivers  parents  and more — happy mother’s day and thank you from a grateful nation my mom taught me about the importance of family  loyalty  and faith  her immeasurable strength lives on in all of her children  her grandchildren  her great grandchildren  and the many other lives that she touched  thank you for tuning into  tonight  go get vaccinated  folks  we can’t just build back to the way things were — we have to build back better with the american jobs plan  the plan will create millions of good paying jobs  make historic investments in innovation  and position america to win the 21st century we have a simple choice to make 

we can keep giving tax breaks to the super wealthy and giant corporations — or we can invest in working families 

i’m going to pick working families every time i am proud of the people i go to work with at the white house every day — but my pride can’t hold a candle to that of their mothers  happy mother’s day and thank you for raising these public servants  the american jobs plan will get americans back to work and our country back on track  it’s time for the wealthy to pay their fair share  it’s time we build an economy that delivers dignity and gives everybody a chance  my jobs cabinet and i are hard at work making sure the working people of this country — the middle class — are no longer left out in the cold  we’re going to make sure they get to share in the benefits of a rising economy with the american jobs plan  my laser focus is on growing the economy and creating jobs  now is the time to pass the american jobs plan — the american people are counting on us  we’re still digging our way out of a very deep hole  no one should underestimate how tough a battle this is  we still have a job to do here in washington  the american people are counting on us  so  let’s get it done tune in as i discuss the april jobs report  the american jobs plan is about building a strong foundation for the american people  i’ve often said  if there are angels in heaven  they’re nurses  nurses have given so much  and saved so many lives throughout the course of this pandemic

it will create good paying jobs modernizing 20 000 miles of highways and roads and repairing 10 000 bridges that desperately need to be upgraded folks  there are no republican roads or democratic bridges  
 
the american jobs plan is a once in a generation investment in america itself tune in as i discuss the american jobs plan in lake charles  louisiana  right now  the united states ranks 13th in the world in infrastructure  it’s unacceptable  we’ve got to pass the american jobs plan and rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure i’m on my way to lake charles to discuss the need to create good paying jobs and rebuild our nation’s infrastructure with the american jobs plan  see you soon  louisiana our restaurant revitalization fund is helping the hard hit food establishments that need it most  that’s the american rescue plan at work  today  on cinco de mayo  we celebrate the legacy of mexican courage and resiliency  i am thankful for the incredible contributions of generations of mexican americans who have served in our military  explored outer space  fed our nation  and created countless jobs  if we want our economy to recover in a way that deals everyone in  then our restaurants need a seat at the table — with the american rescue plan  they have it  
 
thanks to our new restaurant revitalization fund  we’ll be able to help about 100 000 restaurants our vaccination progress and our economic recovery go hand in hand  thanks to the american rescue plan  more than 163 million rescue payments have already gone out — help is here tune in as i give an update on the restaurant revitalization fund and the american rescue plan  in case you missed it – the american families plan will make community college free for millions of americans and provide universal access to high quality  free pre k for 3  and 4 year olds  

that’s a down payment on the future of america  this missing and murdered indigenous persons day  we honor the memory of the indigenous people who we have lost to murder and those who remain missing  

my administration is committed to working with tribal nations to ensure swift and effective action  in two months  let’s celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence from this virus  on this anniversary of the freedom rides  we honor those who courageously took a stand against segregation and injustice sixty years ago  their message of bravery  hope  and unity in diversity continues to inspire us to build a more perfect union for all our goal by july 4th is to have 70  of adult americans with at least one shot — and 160 million americans fully vaccinated  it’s another huge goal  and a serious step toward a return to normal 

get vaccinated  keep following cdc guidance  we can do this it’s easier than ever to find a vaccine appointment  go to   find a location to get the shot  and make an appointment  tune in as i give an update on our covid 19 response and vaccination program  the future for american rail is bright  as i laid out at last week’s 50th anniversary event for amtrak  the american jobs plan will invest in rail and ensure it plays a central role in the economy of the future  commerce secretary raimondo is right  we can’t afford not to rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure and invest in our future  we need to pass the american jobs plan  the u s  refugee admissions program embodies our commitment to protect the most vulnerable  it’s a statement about who we are  and who we want to be  that’s why today  i revised our annual cap from 15 000 — a historic low set by the previous administration — to 62 500 jill and i visited a classroom today where students are back together with their classmates and teachers  we know what being in school together means for those kids — it’s why we worked so hard to safely reopen the majority of k 8 schools in our first 100 days  the american jobs plan is a blue collar blueprint to build america  nearly 90  of the infrastructure jobs created by the plan do not require a college degree families belong together  that’s why i established a family reunification task force in my first weeks as president  we’re working tirelessly to bring families together — and this week we will begin to reunite the first of those families  tune in as the first lady and i discuss the american families plan at tidewater community college  when i think about climate change  i think about jobs 

there s no reason why wind turbine blades can t be built in pittsburgh instead of beijing  none teachers are an extraordinary force for good in our nation — i’m lucky enough to be married to one and have seen firsthand how hard they work for their students  this year teachers have gone above and beyond to help children learn through the pandemic  so please  thank a teacher  last week  i raised the minimum wage to  15 an hour for people working on federal contracts 

now  it’s time for congress to do its part and make a  15 minimum wage the law of the land for every american 

let’s get it done jill and i extend warm wishes to all of our friends in the orthodox christian community observing easter  i have never been more optimistic about the future of america  we have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “we the people” did not flinch  we came together as one america  with light and hope  we summoned new strength and new resolve  as we mark jewish american heritage month  we celebrate the contributions of jewish americans to our nation  jewish americans have helped our nation fulfill its promise and overcome challenges  demonstrating that jewish and american values go hand in hand  health care should be a right  not a privilege in america on this national college signing day  we celebrate all those students chasing their passions and setting the stage for the future  whether you’re committing to community college  technical school  or a four year college or university — i m rooting for you in this next big step this may  during asian american and native hawaiian pacific islander heritage month  we recognize the history and achievements of asian americans  native hawaiians  and pacific islanders across our nation — and recommit to the struggle for aanhpi equality paid leave has helped eldraen and countless others take time off when they need it most – but far too many people can’t do the same  for this weekly conversation  vice president harris sat down to talk about how we can ensure every american has access to paid leave  it’s been a big month  folks  we hit our goal of 200 million shots  announced the end of america’s longest war  hosted a global summit on climate change  introduced the american families plan  and so much more  

excited to see what we accomplish in may  on this momentous 50th birthday for amtrak  i want to thank everyone whose hard work has kept the trains running and opened up possibilities for so many people over the years 
 
i believe that the best days for amtrak  for rail  and for america are still ahead  let me be clear  no one should have to choose between a paycheck and taking care of themselves or their loved ones  the american families plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for every american we have a once in a generation opportunity to position amtrak — and rail in general — to play a central role in our transportation and economic future  to make the investments that can help get america back on track 
 
that’s exactly what the american jobs plan will do join me at philadelphia’s 30th street station as we celebrate amtrak’s 50th anniversary  this is a birthday i certainly wouldn’t miss  

looking forward to celebrating amtrak’s 50th in philadelphia later today  this week  i introduced the american families plan  it’s a historic bill that will make transformational investments in families and rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class  i asked susan rice  domestic policy advisor  to explain more  i will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country  they’re already paying enough  what i’ve proposed is fair  and it’s fiscally responsible  trickle down economics has never worked  madam speaker  madam vice president  no president has ever said those words from this podium — and it’s about time  today marks 100 days since vice president harris and i took office  and we’ve been building back better every day since  it’s never been a good bet to bet against america — and it still isn’t 
 
we are the united states of america  there is nothing we can’t do if we do it together  after 100 days of rescue and renewal  america is ready for takeoff 

we are working again  dreaming again  discovering again  leading the world again 

we have shown each other and the world  there is no quit in america  tonight  i introduced the american families plan — an ambitious  once in a generation investment to rebuild the middle class and invest in america’s future  learn more  we’re vaccinating the nation 

we’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs 

we’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives  opening the doors of opportunity  guaranteeing fairness and justice if we are to truly restore the soul of america  then we need to protect the sacred right to vote 

congress should pass h r  1 and the john lewis voting rights act and send them to my desk right away immigration has always been essential to america 

for more than 30 years  politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it 

it’s time to fix it i will do everything in my power to protect the american people from the epidemic of gun violence  but it’s time for congress to act as well 

this shouldn’t be a red vs  blue issue  it’s an american issue we have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of black america  

now is our opportunity to make real progress — to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice america won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms 

no responsible american president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated trickle down economics has never worked 

it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out a recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year 

no federal taxes on more than  40 billion in profits 

that’s not right  it’s time for corporate america and the wealthiest 1  of americans to pay their fair share 12 years is no longer enough to compete in the 21st century  that’s why the american families plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in america — two years of universal  high quality pre school and two years of free community college to win the competition for the future  we also need to make a once in a generation investment in our families  that’s why i’m introducing the american families plan tonight  which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing american families today doing nothing on infrastructure is not an option 

we can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st century let’s pass the  15 minimum wage 

no one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line independent experts estimate the american jobs plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come  these are good paying jobs that can’t be outsourced the economy created more than 1 3 million new jobs in 100 days 

that’s more new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record  

america is moving forward — and we can’t stop now in my first 100 days  we kept our commitment and we’re sending  1 400 rescue checks to 85  of all american households 

we’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door 

for many people  it’s making all the difference in the world tonight  i can say because of you — the american people — our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen 100 days ago  america’s house was on fire  we had to act  so we 

  passed the american rescue plan
  administered over 200 million shots
  sent over 160 million relief checks
  delivered food and rental assistance to millions
  provided small business loansafter just 100 days i can report to the nation  america is on the move again tune in as i deliver my first address to a joint session of congress  looking forward to tonight’s address to recap our progress and chart a path forward  join me  to make tonight’s joint address accessible for all americans  every white house livestream will have american sign language  asl  interpretation for the first time in history  you can learn more about how to tune in here  tonight  i’ll be delivering my first address to a joint session of congress  you can watch right here on twitter  where we’ll be providing commentary from administration officials throughout the speech  learn more  when the cdc says you don’t have to wear a mask outside if you’re fully vaccinated and not in a crowd  i believe no one should work full time and still live in poverty  that’s why today  i raised the minimum wage to  15 an hour for people working on federal contracts yes  the vaccines are about saving your life and the lives of the people around you  but they are also about helping you get back to normal living 

go get the shot — it’s never been easier because of the extraordinary progress we’ve made in the fight against covid 19  the cdc made a big announcement today  if you are fully vaccinated — and if you are outdoors and not in a large crowd — you no longer need to wear a mask tune in as i deliver an update on our covid 19 response  with the american jobs plan  we’re going to bring quality  affordable high speed internet to every single american — no matter where they live remember  if you received either the pfizer or moderna covid 19 vaccine  you need two doses to receive the full scope of protection  don’t skip your second shot i believe every worker should have a real opportunity to organize and collectively bargain  that’s why today  i established a white house task force on worker organizing and empowerment — helping empower workers to make the right choice for themselves and their families  today  we’re launching a new program funded by the american rescue plan to provide nutrition assistance to more than 30 million children over the summer  help is here to ensure no kid goes hungry in america today  i spoke with prime minister  and pledged america’s full support to provide emergency assistance and resources in the fight against covid 19  india was there for us  and we will be there for them to the millions of americans getting vaccinated every day  your actions are a powerful demonstration of unity and resolve  and a reminder of what we can accomplish when we pull together  thank you for doing your part to protect yourselves  your loved ones  and your neighbors  jill and i send our best wishes to people of the jain faith celebrating mahavir jayanti  mahavir swami guided others to seek truth  turn away from violence  and live in harmony with all beings  may we strive to uphold these values get vaccinated  folks just as india sent assistance to the united states as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic  we are determined to help india in its time of need  don’t forget  a special enrollment period for health insurance is open through august 15  head to  and join the over half a million americans who’ve gotten covered our best days still lie ahead  before i took office  i promised help was on the way  just three months in  i’m proud to say help is here  we’ve delivered over 150 million relief checks  administered over 200 million shots  and are working hard to build back better every day america has never been unable to meet a challenge if we put our minds to it 
 
i know we can tackle the threat of climate change while seizing the opportunities of a cleaner  stronger  and more resilient economy 
 
let’s get to work the truth is i’m a union president  and i make no bones about that  i’m committed to strengthening our unions and rebuilding the backbone of this country — the middle class  i sat down to talk with louis about my plans to make it happen  it is time for congress to eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability 
 
i thank congressman schiff and senator blumenthal for their leadership  and urge congress to swiftly repeal this immunity it’s long past time giant corporations pay their fair share 
 
i believe we should raise the corporate tax rate  then use that money to rebuild our infrastructure  expand high speed internet  and ensure every american has clean drinking water 
 
let’s make it happen there’s no time to waste when it comes to the existential threat of climate change  that’s why i’ve set a bold new goal of cutting u s  greenhouse gas emissions at least in half by 2030 from the moment we took office  my administration has been working around the clock to get america vaccinated quickly and equitably 

here’s a breakdown of our progress  no one should be denied a roof over their head simply because of their gender identity  today   took action to make that clear  to all the states  cities  tribal nations  businesses  and organizations that stepped up the past four years to lead on tackling climate change  thank you  
 
today we announced a new national target and from here on out  you’ll have a partner in me and my administration we’ve officially passed 200 million shots since the start of our administration  it’s a big milestone  but we still have a long way to go  get vaccinated  folks  i applaud the senate and the congressional asian pacific american caucus for passing the covid 19 hate crimes act — and for bringing us closer to achieving justice and equality for the aapi community 

acts of hate against asian americans are wrong  un american  and must stop no nation can solve the climate crisis on our own — all of us have to step up  today’s leaders summit on climate is our first step to set our world on a path to a secure  prosperous  and sustainable future 
 
time is short  but i believe that we can and will do this  today  we officially reached our goal of 200 million shots in my first 100 days 
 
make no mistake  this is an american achievement  it’s a powerful demonstration of unity and resolve  and a reminder of what we can accomplish when we come together in pursuit of a common goal america is back  we rejoined the paris agreement and are ready to rally the world to tackle the climate crisis  let’s do this the signs are unmistakable 
the science is undeniable 
the costs of inaction keep mounting

we cannot let them die with him  we have to keep hearing them 
 
we must not turn away  we cannot turn away there’s meaningful police reform legislation in george floyd’s name  but it shouldn’t take a year to get it done 
 
i assured the floyd family that we’re going to continue to fight for the passage of the george floyd justice in policing act so i can sign it into law right away no one should be above the law 
 
today’s verdict sends that message  but it is not enough  we can’t stop here 
 
in order to deliver real change and reform  we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedies like this ever occur today  a jury in minnesota found former minneapolis police officer derek chauvin guilty of murdering george floyd

stay socially distanced 
wash your hands 
get vaccinated 
 
now is not the time to let up in the battle against covid 19 — we have to fight this to the end we can’t just build back to the way things were before the pandemic — we need to reimagine and build a new american economy our nation’s caregivers have been undervalued for far too long — and it’s time they receive the pay and benefits they deserve  i sat down with susie from texas to discuss how the american jobs plan will help caregivers like her  i was honored to welcome prime minister suga to the white house today as we usher in a new era of friendship between the u s  and japan  both pacific nations  we are also united by our shared commitment to the universal values of freedom  democracy  and human rights  prime minister suga — thank you for making the long trip to washington  it was a pleasure to host you at the white house  i know we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other in the years to come as we work side by side to ensure a free and open indo pacific region  i just wrapped up my first in person bilateral meeting as president with japanese prime minister suga  tune in as we hold a joint press conference  vice president harris and i have been briefed on the mass shooting at a fedex facility in indianapolis  god bless the eight individuals we lost and their loved ones  and we pray for the wounded for their recovery  

we can  and must  do more to reduce gun violence and save lives i’m looking forward to welcoming my friend prime minister suga to the white house this afternoon for the first foreign leader visit of my presidency — and to renewing the historic alliance between the united states and japan equal pay is about justice  fairness  and who we are as a nation — and it makes all of us stronger  i’m glad the house passed the paycheck fairness act to help close the gender pay gap — and i urge the senate to swiftly do the same this afternoon  vice president harris and i met with congressional asian pacific american caucus leaders in the oval office  we doubled down on our commitment to combat anti asian hate and discussed working together on everything from the american jobs plan to immigration  thank you  for stepping up and taking action to save lives  it’s long past time we pass common sense gun reforms in every corner of the country to end our gun violence epidemic  this afternoon  i’m delivering remarks on the new sanctions the united states is imposing on russia  tune in  right now  the united states ranks 13th in the world in infrastructure — but we have the power to change that  the american jobs plan will modernize our roads  fix our bridges  invest in public transportation  and make our infrastructure more resilient to climate change there are a lot of myths out there about the american jobs plan — so i asked  to clear a few things up  when we’ve invested in innovation throughout our history  we’ve been rewarded in extraordinary ways 

we have that opportunity once again  i am immeasurably grateful for the bravery that members of our armed forces have shown through nearly two decades of combat and deployments in afghanistan  they have never backed down  they have never wavered in their resolve  and they have paid a tremendous price on our behalf  our diplomacy does not hinge on having u s  boots in harm’s way  

we have to change that thinking i am now the fourth american president to preside over an american troop presence in afghanistan 

i will not pass this responsibility to a fifth  we went to afghanistan because of the horrific attacks on 9 11 that happened 20 years ago 

that cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021 

rather than return to war with the taliban  we have to focus on the challenges of the future it is time to end america’s longest war  

it is time for american troops to come home from afghanistan this afternoon  i’m announcing the withdrawal of u s  troops from afghanistan and providing an update on the path forward  watch live  in less than three months  we’ve more than tripled the number of daily vaccinations 

that’s progress  this afternoon  vice president harris and i met with members of the congressional black caucus at the white house  we’re committed to working together to make progress on everything from policing reform and voting rights to economic opportunity and racial equity  today  the fda and cdc recommended a pause in the use of the johnson  amp  johnson vaccine  here’s what you need to know  jill and i send our warmest wishes to the south asian and southeast asian communities who are celebrating vaisakhi  navratri  songkran  and the incoming new year this week  happy bengali  cambodian  lao  myanmarese  nepali  sinhalese  tamil  thai  and vishu new year this can be the moment that america wins the future — but it’s going to take all of us to make it happen 

let’s do big things  together  “when the will defies fear  when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate  when honor scorns to compromise with death — that is heroism ” — r g  ingersoll 

capitol police officer william evans was a hero  race should never determine health outcomes — and pregnancy and childbirth should be safe for all  but for too many black women  safety and equity have been denied  this black maternal health week  our administration is taking action to change that  we can’t let the divisions of the moment stop us from doing right by our future  that’s why this afternoon  i brought together a bipartisan group of lawmakers to discuss how we can build america’s infrastructure back better with the american jobs plan  as the crescent moon ushers in the month  jill and i send our warmest greetings and best wishes to muslim communities in the united states and around the world  ramadan kareem today i’m thinking about daunte wright and his family — and the pain  anger  and trauma that black america experiences every day  while we await a full investigation  we know what we need to do to move forward  rebuild trust and ensure accountability so no one is above the law when i served as vice president  i asked to be the last person with the president before big decisions were made — and  is providing the same counsel to me  she’s the last voice in the room and never fails to speak the truth as we work to build our nation back better  it’s time we invest in the future of america once again our progress on vaccinations is proof that there’s nothing america can’t achieve when we do it together  gun violence in this country is an epidemic — and it’s long past time congress take action this isn’t complicated  the american jobs plan is a once in a generation opportunity to invest in the future of america  for this episode of our weekly conversation  i invited members of my jobs cabinet to break down their favorite parts  a new study put out just last week found that at least 55 of our largest corporations used various loopholes to pay  0 in federal income taxes in 2020 

it’s not fair to the rest of the american taxpayers — and we’re going to put an end to it high speed internet is essential infrastructure in the 21st century  i’m excited to share my official portrait — and honored to serve as your president every day  universal background checks are supported by the vast majority of americans — and the majority of gun owners 

so let’s be clear  this is not a partisan issue  it’s an american issue prince philip’s legacy will live on not only through his family  but in all the charitable endeavors he shaped  jill and i are keeping the queen and prince philip’s children  grandchildren  great grandchildren  and the people of the united kingdom in our hearts during this time i know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one  but even here  there’s much more common ground than some would have us believe  we need to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines in this country  

there’s no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine  none we need more than “thoughts and prayers” from congress  it’s time to act  on this holocaust remembrance day  we remember the precious lives we lost and honor those who survived to bear witness  we must all give anti semitism and hate no safe harbor and ensure the atrocities of the holocaust never occur again the senate should immediately pass the three house passed bills to close loopholes in the gun background check system 

that is one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence and save lives my administration is taking initial steps to reduce gun violence  including 

  stopping the proliferation of ghost guns
  regulating pistols modified with a stabilizing brace
  helping states adopt red flag laws
  supporting community violence interventionstoday  i’m joining vice president harris and attorney general garland to announce new actions to reduce gun violence  tune in  whatever partisan divisions there are around other issues — there don’t have to be on infrastructure 

we’re one nation — united and connected  it’s time we focus on our nation’s caregiving infrastructure — the kind of infrastructure that helps people build a better life and carve out their place in the middle class  we need to start seeing infrastructure through the eyes of working people  two hundred years ago trains weren’t “traditional” infrastructure either — until america made the choice to lay the tracks the idea of infrastructure has always evolved to meet the aspirations of the american people — and it’s evolving again today  we are america  

we don’t just fix for today  

we build for tomorrow above all  infrastructure is about meeting the needs of the nation and putting americans to work to get the job done this afternoon  i’m delivering remarks on the historic infrastructure investments in the american jobs plan  tune in  this afternoon  i stopped by a vaccination clinic at the virginia theological seminary  it’s an example of the kind of partnerships we’re seeing around the country — people coming together across different faiths to serve those most in need  it’s america at its best  according to the latest cdc data  almost 80 percent of pre k through 12 teachers  school staff  and childcare workers received at least one shot by the end of march  that is great progress in protecting our educators – our essential workers despite the progress we’re making as a nation  i want every american to know in no uncertain terms that the fight against covid 19 isn’t over  by april 19  every adult will be eligible to be vaccinated i’m proud to share that yesterday  we crossed 150 million shots in just 75 days of my administration — on our way to hitting our goal of 200 million shots by my 100th day in office my administration is working to get america vaccinated as quickly as possible  tune in as i provide an update on our progress and the timeline moving forward  it’s time to rebuild america now is not the time to let up in our fight against covid 19  we have to hold the line while everyone gets vaccinated  keep wearing a mask  stay socially distanced  and wash your hands 

let’s fight this to the end congrats to the baylor bears on their national championship — and to the gonzaga bulldogs on a great season  after an unimaginable year  every team in the tournament proved what’s possible with hard work and determination  you made your schools  communities  and country proud broadband is infrastructure our easter celebrations looked different this year  like they did for so many others across the country  but we look forward to next year when the white house will ring with the joy of the season — and god willing  there’ll be an easter egg roll once again  here’s the deal  wall street didn’t build this country — the great american middle class did  it’s time we rebuild the middle class and bring everyone along regardless of race  gender  religion  ethnicity  sexual orientation  or disability although this year looks different  the rich history of easter at the white house carries on  tune in as i deliver remarks  congratulations to  on their ncaa women s basketball championship win  and to  on a hard fought season  

this year  every college team went through a uniquely challenging season but coach vanderveer s team shows how grit and tenacity can prevail from our family to yours  we wish you health  hope  joy  and peace  happy easter  everyone  my administration is working to get america vaccinated as quickly as possible  and this week  we took additional steps to make vaccines more accessible  by april 19  90  of americans will live within 5 miles of a place to get a shot the american jobs plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work building a modern  resilient  and fully clean grid  i can’t believe i have to say this  but giant corporations shouldn’t pay less in taxes than a teacher or a firefighter  

we’re going to change that – and ensure corporations finally pay their fair share with the made in america tax plan the american jobs plan will 
  modernize 20 000 miles of highways and roads
  repair 10 000 bridges in need of upgrade
  build new rail corridors and transit lines
  reduce bottlenecks at our ports and airports
  tackle the climate crisisthis week  i announced the american jobs plan  which will invest in our infrastructure and strengthen america’s competitiveness for decades to come  my team and i answered your questions about the plan  tune in  if we act now  people are going to look back and say  “this was the moment that america won the future ” the american jobs plan is a once in a generation investment in the future of america  a cabinet that looks like america  the american jobs plan will make sure every single american has access to high quality  affordable  high speed internet the american jobs plan will ensure every american can turn on the faucet or fountain and drink clean water  i am convinced that if we act now with the american jobs plan  in fifty years people will look back and say this was the moment america won the future two years ago  i began my campaign in pittsburgh  saying i was running to rebuild the backbone of america 

today  i returned as president to lay out a vision for how we do that 

we’re going to rebuild the middle class — and this time  we’re going to bring everyone along  let me be clear  we’re going to ensure corporations finally pay their fair share  the american jobs plan will create millions of good paying jobs  grow our economy  make us more competitive  promote our national security interests  and put us in a position to win the global competition with china  historically  infrastructure has been bipartisan  

there is no reason it can’t be bipartisan again 

the divisions of the moment shouldn’t stop us from doing right by the future in 2019  an independent analysis found that there were 91 fortune 500 companies that used various loopholes to pay  0 in federal income taxes on u s  income  

that’s just wrong — and we will put an end to it with the made in america tax plan the american jobs plan is a once in a generation investment in america unlike anything we have seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and won the space race decades ago 

it’s big  it’s bold  and we can get it done here’s the truth  we all do better when we all do well 

it’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out — not the top down this afternoon  i’m in pittsburgh to discuss the american jobs plan  tune in  in the 21st century  in the wealthiest nation in the world  everyone should have access to high speed internet — no matter where they live  we can make that possible  i’m on my way to pennsylvania to discuss my economic vision for the future and how we’re going to build back better for the american people  see you soon  pittsburgh infrastructure isn’t just about roads and bridges — it’s about our global competitiveness  and as we continue to fall back  the rest of the world is closing in  we can’t allow this to continue  we have to invest in america again  over the last few months  we’ve seen the rising cost of our aging power grid firsthand  we can modernize it  make it greener  and create millions of jobs — all at the same time  let’s do this  far too many americans lack access to affordable public transit — and those who do have access are often met with delays and disruptions  we have the power to change that  modernize public transit  and expand access for people across the country  transgender rights are human rights — and i’m calling on every american to join me in uplifting the worth and dignity of transgender americans  together  we can stamp out discrimination and deliver on our nation’s promise of freedom and equality for all  every single american has a right to clean drinking water  it’s just plain wrong that in the united states of america today  millions of children still receive their water through lead service pipes  it’s long past time we fix that  the paycheck protection program has served as a crucial lifeline for small businesses during this pandemic  today  i signed the bipartisan ppp extension act of 2021 to extend the application deadline and ensure more small businesses can get the support they need  nominating judges who reflect america is a top priority  that’s why today i announced 11 nominees — the earliest any administration has announced this many judges in modern history  they represent the best of the legal profession and the diversity that makes our nation strong  there is nothing america can’t do if we put our minds to it  we can’t be silent in the face of rising violence against asian americans  that’s why today i’m taking additional steps to respond–including establishing an initiative at the department of justice to address anti asian crimes 

these attacks are wrong  un american  and must stop we have a sacred obligation to care for our nation’s veterans and their families  the american rescue plan will help deliver on that obligation by ensuring access to va health care and providing immediate economic relief in the next three weeks  we will more than double the number of pharmacies where you can get vaccinated and increase the number of federally run mass vaccination sites  

we’re going to make sure that 90  of americans live within 5 miles of a vaccination site by april 19 this vietnam war veterans day  and every day  we remember the brave members of our armed forces who sacrificed so much in service of our nation  we owe them and their families more than we could ever repay  we’ve made enormous progress when it comes to covid 19  but new variants are spreading quickly  now is not the time to let up — we have to hold the line while we get the country vaccinated 

wash your hands 
stay socially distanced 
wear a mask 
get vaccinated when you can over the last three days  we have had a record number of shots in arms with nearly 10 million shots recorded 

that would have been inconceivable in january i’m proud to announce that three weeks from today  90  of adults will be eligible to get vaccinated — and 90  of americans will live within 5 miles of a place to get a shot vice president harris and i just wrapped up a covid 19 briefing  tune in as i give an update on our response to the virus and the state of vaccinations  that’s a big deal  i urge congress to pass the for the people act and the john lewis voting rights advancement act  we need to make it easier for all eligible americans to access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote two weeks ago  i directed all states  tribes  and territories to make all adult americans eligible for the vaccine no later than may 1 — and we’re already making progress  if you have the best ideas  you have nothing to hide  let the people vote  equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue  this week  the first lady and i sat down with megan rapinoe and margaret purce to discuss our progress in the fight for equal pay and the work that lies ahead  on this national day of action and healing  my administration stands united with the asian american community in the face of rising violence  hate can have no safe harbor in america  it must stop — and it’s on all of us together to make it stop the georgia voting law — like so many others being pursued by republicans in statehouses across the country — is a blatant attack on the right to vote  the constitution  and good conscience 

it’s jim crow in the 21st century — and it must end as we recall the passover story of overcoming adversity  finding hope  and becoming free  we find a renewed salience  this weekend  as seders close with the familiar refrain  “next year in jerusalem ” we offer an additional prayer  next year in person  next year  together  a strong european union is in america’s interest  that s why yesterday  i met with  and the  to revitalize u s  eu relations  as we partner up to combat covid  tackle the climate crisis  and ensure democracies rather than autocracies set rules of the road  i ran for president for three reasons  to restore the soul of the nation  rebuild the middle class  and unite the country  i set a goal to have the majority of k 8 schools reopened within my first 100 days  and i’m happy to report  we’re on track to meet and exceed that goal  today  i congratulated  on the bicentennial of greek independence  from defense and energy to trade and investment  our close relationship is stronger today than ever since we passed the american rescue plan  we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy  the republican efforts to block americans from voting are sick  pernicious  and despicable  communities across the country are struggling because of covid 19 — but help is here  the american rescue plan provides funding to ramp up vaccinations  safely reopen schools  lift up small businesses  and move forward on this national medal of honor day  we recognize the brave service members whose heroism and courage earned them our nation’s highest military decoration  we must never forget their acts of valor and the sacrifices they made in defense of our country as of yesterday  more than 100 million  1 400 payments have gone into people’s bank accounts — real money in people’s pockets  help is here  today  i’m setting a new goal  200 million shots in arms by my 100th day in office  before i took office  i set a big goal of 100 million shots in my first 100 days 
 
we hit the goal on day 58 
 
now  i’m setting a new one  200 million shots in my first 100 days 
 
let’s do this i’ve been hired to solve problems  not create divisions this afternoon  i’m holding my first formal press conference as president  tune in  equal pay day is a big deal around here  right   and  100purcent  equal pay for equal work is common sense — and it’s long overdue  as president  i’m committed to closing the gap once and for all  it doesn’t matter if you’re an electrician  an accountant  or part of the best soccer team in the world — the pay gap is real  but with megan  margaret  and countless others leading the fight for equal pay  i’m confident we’ll finally close it  the pandemic and economic crisis have greatly impacted women and families — but with the american rescue plan  help is here  the law increases the child tax credit  cuts child poverty in half  expands child care assistance  and provides funding to open k 8 schools 66  of the tax breaks in the american rescue plan go to folks making  90 000 or less 

the top one percent get zero  we’ve got to rebuild the middle class and ensure every worker is treated with dignity and respect  as the new secretary of labor   will play a crucial role in that effort  i know he’ll fight every single day for the hardworking americans who make our country run  to mark equal pay day   and i are hosting an event with megan rapinoe  margaret purce  and members of the u s  soccer women’s national team  tune in  ambassador bill burns has dealt with many of the most complex global challenges we face — and approached them with honesty  integrity  and skill  i know that’s exactly how he’ll lead the cia every single day  this morning  i signed the save lives act into law — expanding the va’s authority and allowing them to provide covid 19 vaccinations to all veterans  their spouses  and caregivers    and i share the belief that health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few  i look forward to working with him to ensure every single american has access to the quality  affordable care they deserve  this afternoon in columbus  i met with ohio governor mike dewine to discuss our coordinated response to covid 19  the virus doesn’t just impact red or blue states — it impacts us all — and i’m committed to working across the aisle to defeat it  before the affordable care act  the radiation oncology department at the james cancer center treated 60 70 patients a day  now  they’re able to treat close to 300  the hospital is a source of hope for the community and an example of what america can achieve if we work together  when we opened a special enrollment period for health insurance in february  over 200 000 americans gained coverage in the first two weeks  today  we’re extending the enrollment period to august 15 
 
head to  to find a plan that works best for you  when it comes to trade  we need to pursue policies that put american businesses  workers  and communities first  there’s no one better qualified to carry out that mission than   i believe every american deserves access to quality  affordable health care  the american rescue plan is working to make that a reality by increasing subsidies  lowering costs  and expanding coverage for people across the country  help is here small businesses are the backbone of communities across the country  but far too many are struggling to keep their doors open  i know  will work every day to support our small businesses and help them emerge stronger from this pandemic  today marks eleven years since the affordable care act was signed into law  the landmark legislation has changed countless lives  but our work isn’t done  i’m committed to ensuring every american has the peace of mind that comes with quality  affordable health care  the affordable care act was signed into law eleven years ago today  tune in as i deliver remarks on the anniversary and how we’re expanding americans’ access to health care  we can ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines 
 
we can close loopholes in our gun background check system 
 
this is not a partisan issue — it’s an american issue that will save lives  congress needs to act there is a great deal we do not know about the killer  his motivation  and other critical aspects about this shooting  but know this  as president  i will use all the resources at my disposal to keep the american people safe jill and i are devastated for the lives that have been shattered by gun violence in colorado  less than a week after the horrific murders in georgia  another american city is scarred by a senseless attack  our hearts go out to the victims  their families  and the survivors less than a week after the horrific murders of eight people in georgia  another american city has been scarred by gun violence  tune in as i deliver remarks  the faster america gets vaccinated  the sooner we can return to our lives with our loved ones  that’s why i’m proud to share we set another record this weekend with 6 million shots reported administered across the country there are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as americans  one of them is standing together against racism — the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation 

it’s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor in america under the american rescue plan  the typical family of four is getting a  5 600 check  that money helps folks keep a roof over their head and put food on the table  help is here mask up  america  they really know how to make an irishman feel special at the white house  progress  the cdc represents the best of this nation  brilliant minds  deep faith in science  and a strong commitment to public service  on friday  vice president harris and i stopped by to thank them for all the work they do  in two months  we’ve 

  passed the american rescue plan
  administered 100 million shots
  rejoined the paris agreement
  reversed the transgender military and muslim bans
  expanded access to health care and voting
  acted to end private prisons

and we re just getting started two months down  like countless people across the country  jocelyn and her family are struggling to make ends meet  i gave her a call to discuss how the american rescue plan will help  this afternoon  vice president harris and i sat down with asian american leaders in atlanta  it was a heart wrenching meeting that made clear the urgent work that lies ahead  we must come together as one america  stand against hate  and root out racism wherever we find it  silence is complicity — and we cannot be complicit 

we have to speak out  we have to act  too many asian americans have been waking up each morning this past year fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones  for all the good that laws can do  we have to change our hearts 

hate can have no safe harbor in america 

it must stop — and it’s on all of us together to make it stop words have consequences  

it’s called the coronavirus

this coming week  our administration will likely administer over 12 million shots 

that’s double the pace in just six weeks covid 19 vaccinations are up and cases and hospitalizations are down  but let me be clear  now is not the time to relax  transgender rights are human rights — and the house made that clear today by passing the equality act

that’s what the american rescue plan will do  this afternoon  i visited the department of defense to meet with officials and deliver remarks to the incredible service members and civilians  serving as commander in chief is the honor of my lifetime and an enormous responsibility — one that i promise i will never take lightly  i spoke today with president xi to offer good wishes to the chinese people for lunar new year  i also shared concerns about beijing’s economic practices  human rights abuses  and coercion of taiwan  i told him i will work with china when it benefits the american people the risk isn t that we do too much when it comes to a covid relief package — it s that we don t do enough
